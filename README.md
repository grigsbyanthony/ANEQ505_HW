# **ANEQ 505:** Microbiome of Animal Systems

**Colorado State University** | Spring 2026
 *January 21 – May 8, 2026*

**Instructor:** [Dr. Jessica L. Metcalf](https://www.jessicalmetcalf.com/)

**Schedule:**

- **Lectures:** Mon/Wed 11:00–11:50am (Animal Science 31)
- **Lab/Recitation:** Fri 11:00am–12:50pm (Chemistry B301)

An unofficial resource repository for **[ANEQ 505](https://catalog.colostate.edu/general-catalog/courses-az/aneq/)**, maintained by [Anthony Grigsby](https://github.com/grigsbyanthony). This repo contains supplementary materials, tutorials, and literature in-line with the coursework—alongside the actively ongoing coursework itself. The course itself provides background knowledge and practical skills for analyzing microbiome data sets.  It covers **microbial ecology theory**, **amplicon sequencing**, and **hands-on experience with QIIME2** for 16S rRNAanalysis.

## **Key Tools & Resources**

-  **QIIME2** – Primary analysis platform ([docs.qiime2.org](https://docs.qiime2.org/))
- **ALPINE HPC** – CSU's high-performance computing cluster
- **Obsidian** – For note-taking and organization
- **GitHub** – Used for homework assignments and documentation
